## OpenAPI Specs for Zapier Public APIs

An exercise for the evaluation of OpenAPI 3 Spec & Tools.

- partner_api.yaml contains an OpenAPI version 3 spec for the Partner API as it's documented here: https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/zap-templates-for-partners-api/

The best way to view and test is to go to https://editor.swagger.io/ and open the spec there.

The OpenAPI Specification lives here: https://swagger.io/specification/
